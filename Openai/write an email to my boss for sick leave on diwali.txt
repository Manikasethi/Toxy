Subject: Request for Sick Leave on Diwali due to Health Concerns

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request a sick leave for the upcoming Diwali festival on [specific dates] as I am currently facing some health issues that require immediate attention and rest.

Considering the significance of Diwali and the fact that it is one of the most important festivals celebrated by our community, I understand the importance of being present during this period. However, my health condition necessitates that I take this time to recover and ensure my well-being.

Given the nature of my illness, it is crucial for me to abstain from any physically strenuous activities or exposure to loud noises, bright lights, and pollution. As you may be aware, Diwali celebrations often involve fireworks and other activities that could potentially exacerbate my symptoms and hinder my recovery process.

I assure you that I have taken all necessary steps to address and manage my health concerns. I have consulted with a healthcare professional who has advised sufficient rest during this period, along with prescribed medications and precautions. By taking the necessary medical leave, I intend to prioritize my recovery, regain my strength, and return to work in a healthier and more productive condition.

I understand
