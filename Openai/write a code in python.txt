OpenAI response for Prompt using artificial intelligence write a code in python 
 *********************************************  

Sure, here's an example of a simple code using artificial intelligence in Python:

```
import random

# Define a list of words
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

# Define a function to generate a random word
def generate_random_word():
    return random.choice(words)

# Define a function to guess the word
def guess_word():
    word_to_guess = generate_random_word()
    guessed_word = ''
    
    while guessed_word != word_to_guess:
        guessed_word = input('Guess the word: ')
        
        if guessed_word == word_to_guess:
            print('Congratulations! You guessed it right.')
            break
        else:
            print('Wrong guess. Try again.')

# Run the game
guess_word()
```

In this code, artificial intelligence is used to randomly select a word from a list and the user is prompted to input their guess. If the guess matches the selected word, a success message is displayed, otherwise, the user is prompted to try again.
