I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to formally request leave for Diwali, which falls on [date]. As an integral part of the company, I greatly value the tradition and significance of Diwali and wish to celebrate this joyous occasion with my family and loved ones.

It is a time when families come together to exchange greetings, participate in traditional rituals, and indulge in delicious food. This year, I would like to join my family in these festivities and create cherished memories.

Considering the cultural importance of Diwali, I kindly request your approval for leave from [start date] to [end date], totaling [number of days]. During my absence, I will ensure that my pending tasks and responsibilities are delegated and communicated clearly to my team members.

I understand that during holiday periods, the workload can be significant, and I would be more than willing to make any necessary adjustments to ease
