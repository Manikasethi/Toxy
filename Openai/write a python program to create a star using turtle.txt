OpenAI response for Prompt  using artificial intelligence write a python program to create a star using turtle 
 *************************  

To create a star using the turtle graphics module in Python, we can write a program that uses artificial intelligence to plot the star points dynamically. Here's an example program that accomplishes this:

```python
import turtle

def create_star(t, size):
    for _ in range(5):
        t.forward(size)
        t.right(144)

def main():
    wn = turtle.Screen()
    wn.bgcolor("black")

    pen = turtle.Turtle()
    pen.color("white")
    pen.speed(3)

    size = 100

    # Move turtle to starting position
    pen.penup()
    pen.goto(-size/2, size/2)
    pen.pendown()

    create_star(pen, size)

    turtle.done()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program uses the `turtle` module to create a window and a turtle object. The `create_star()` function takes in a turtle object `t` and the size of the star `size`. It uses a loop to draw the five sides of the star by moving the turtle forward and turning it right by 144 degrees.

In the `main()` function, a turtle object is created with a white color, and the turtle's speed is
